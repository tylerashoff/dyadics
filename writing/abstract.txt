This study seeks to understand the level of agreement between two human and machine coded event databases, the COPDAB dataset and Cline Center Historical Phoenix dataset respectively. The investigation of dyadic relationships between six countries from 1955 to 1978, shows that there are conditions where this agreement is strong. However, this is not always the case. In many instances especially at lower levels of aggregation, this agreement weakens drastically.
